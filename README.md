# GeoMapping-Visualizing-Data-with-Leaflet

Earthquake-Visualization
Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes and faultlines based on their longitude and latitude to find the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
>The map image(s) shows the earthquake data over the last 7 days.  Color and size of the circles correspond to the magnitude of the earthquake.  Click the circles for additional information (such as date, time:EST, proximity to near town/metro area, magnitude of the earthquake and the number of people who reported feeling it).
